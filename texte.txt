Time, baby it's time,
To get back our love again,
I will be there,
I will be there..

Love, only love,
Can bring back your love someday,
I will be there,
I will be there..

If we'd go again,
All the way from the start.
I will try to change,
The things that killed our love..
Your pride has built a wall,
So strong, that I can't get through.
Is there really no chance,
To start once again..
I'm loving you..
